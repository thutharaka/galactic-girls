Star Quest is a space-themed productivity web app that turns completing tasks into a fun, visual experience. Each completed task makes a star shine in the galaxy ✨

We wanted to make task-tracking more engaging and motivating. Inspired by space, stars, and exploration, we designed a to-do list where productivity directly affects a living star map.

Specific Features
- Space & Star Theme - A cosmic UI inspired by galaxies and stars  
- Interactive To-Do List
  - Add new tasks
  - Mark tasks as completed
  - Cross out completed tasks
- Star Map Progression
  - Each completed task lights up a star
  - Progress is visual, rewarding, and fun
- Meet the Galactic Girls behind the project


We built this webpage with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Overview of each page

- Home - Introduction to the project
- To-Do - Add, complete, and manage tasks
- Star Map – Stars shine as tasks are completed  
- About – Team information  

How the webpage works
1. User adds a task in the To-Do List page
2. When a task is completed:
   - The task is crossed out and a star lights up on the Star Map
3. More completed tasks = a brighter galaxy

✨ *Turn productivity into a journey through the stars.* ✨
